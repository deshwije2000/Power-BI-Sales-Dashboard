## 📝 Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive sales analysis dashboard built from the ground up using Microsoft Power BI. 
The goal was to take a raw dataset of superstore sales, transform it into a usable format, and create a user-friendly dashboard to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and identify trends. 
This allows for data-driven decision-making regarding sales strategy, profitability, and customer segmentation.
